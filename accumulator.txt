/* @This is the first change I made in this file  in order see how the f******* git is working
 @this is the second change. "test branch was just created". this change I am making now will be
detected by Git.. and probably. my assumption is that I would have options to choose.. 
I could add this change into "Staging Environment" and then able to commit. by which new version of
file would created...... am I right?? You will see the answer in the next line.


/* 
public class Accumulator {
	static int sum;
	static void add(int i) {
		sum+=i;
	}
	static void showResult() {
		System.out.println("sum = " + sum);
	}
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			Accumulator.add(i);
		}
		Accumulator.showResult();
